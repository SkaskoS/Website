# Website
This website is my first site built, I am slowly still working on it but so far it is computer friendly so looking at it from the mobile device is a little quirky. Just a side note: I am not sure how copyright goes for websites but I would like to metion none of these images or gifs belong to me. I got them from google and edited a few but otherwise are not mine at all. Credit to all those amazing designers and artists that created those wonderful images. Although I wish I had a cat who eats snacks with their paws like that but unfortunately I do not :(
